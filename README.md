# odin-recipes
This project will create a website that will consist of a main index page that will have multiple links to different recipes.

This website will be created with HTML language as well with the utilization of the command line (Bash), a text editor (VScode), a version control system (Git) and remote repository (Github) to track/log the history of edits and changes throughout the entirety of the project.
